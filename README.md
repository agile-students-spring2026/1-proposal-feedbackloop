# Project Proposal

## Title: FeedbackLoop

### What and why?
This project will build a web platform for small indie game teams to share development updates, organize playtests, and collect player feedback in one place.

Many small teams currently use tools such as Discord, itch.io, and social media to communicate with players and gather feedback. However, feedback is often spread across different platforms and is hard to organize and track. Players also do not have a place to discover new playtests or follow the progress of the games they like. The scattered information makes the already difficult situation of independent games even harder to survive. By creating a simple and centralized platform, it can improve the feedback process for both developers and players.


### For whom?
For small indie game teams who want to collect player feedback and promotes their game. It is also for players who like indie games and enjoy trying early game prototypes.


### How?
The system will allow game teams to create a project page where they can post updates and share playtest builds. They can also design custom feedback forms with ratings and questions based on their testing goals. Players can browse available projects, join playtests, and submit their feedback.

Developers can organize feedback using tags and summary statistics. We can also help teams analyze player profiles based on user data. Players can follow projects they are interested in and receive updates. The platform also highlights active projects based on recent feedback activity and player interests, helping users discover relevant games.

### Scope
Core features such as project pages, custom feedback forms, ratings, and basic feedback organization are not technically complex to implement. Optional features such as trending projects and player profiles involve data processing and visualization, which add an additional level of challenge. These features can be implemented if time allows.
